# My First API App

## Introduction

Hi there! ðŸ‘‹ This is my very first app that connects to an API. Iâ€™ve always been a fan of _The Lord of the Rings_, so I decided to create something fun using **The One API**. This app pulls data about books, movies, characters, and quotes from the world of Middle-earth.

Iâ€™m a beginner developer, and this project has been a great way to learn about working with APIs. I hope you enjoy exploring it as much as I enjoyed building it! ðŸ˜Š

## Features

Hereâ€™s what my app can do:

- Show all _The Lord of the Rings_ books and their chapters.
- List movies from _The Lord of the Rings_ and _The Hobbit_ trilogies.
- Explore characters, quotes, and more from the films.

## How It Works

Iâ€™m using **The One API**, which provides awesome data from the _The Lord of the Rings_ universe. Below are the routes my app connects to:

### API Endpoints

All routes start with:  
`https://the-one-api.dev/v2`

#### Open Access (No Authentication Required)

- **`/book`**  
  Get a list of all _The Lord of the Rings_ books.

- **`/book/{id}`**  
  Get details about a specific book (replace `{id}` with the book's ID).

- **`/book/{id}/chapter`**  
  See all chapters from a specific book.

#### Requires Authentication (API Token Needed)

- **`/movie`**  
  List all movies, including _The Lord of the Rings_ and _The Hobbit_ trilogies.

- **`/movie/{id}`**  
  Get details about a specific movie.

- **`/movie/{id}/quote`**  
  See all quotes from a specific movie (only works for _The Lord of the Rings_ trilogy).

- **`/character`**  
  List characters with information like name, gender, race, and more.

- **`/character/{id}`**  
  Get details about a specific character.

- **`/character/{id}/quote`**  
  See all quotes spoken by a specific character.

- **`/quote`**  
  Get all quotes from the movies.

- **`/quote/{id}`**  
  Get details of a specific quote.

- **`/chapter`**  
  See a list of all book chapters.

- **`/chapter/{id}`**  
  Get details about a specific book chapter.

### Lessons Learned

As this is my first app using an API, I learned a lot about:

- Sending API requests and handling responses.
- Working with authentication tokens.
- Structuring a project for APIs.
- Itâ€™s been an exciting journey, and I canâ€™t wait to build more! ðŸš€
